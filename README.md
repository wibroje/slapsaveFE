## Objectives and User Stores
*I set out to build an app that would be useful for pinball players of all calibers.  

*I wanted to create a feature that allowed users to search for a specific machine and provided results of 'the nearest machine is at X arcade in X city at X address'.  

*I was not able to attain my original goal, however, I made machines searchable with a little tutorial video for each.  

*I will keep working on this app to a point where I can get relational data working (machines, venues, events, users).  

*User should be able to search machines and figure out where they can go to play it.  

*User should be able to search venues and figure out which machines are available there.  

*User should be able to pull up a tutorial for machines so they can see common strategies.  

*User should be able to add pinball events such as tournaments, and use data from machines and venues.

### Going forward

I will absolutely continue to develop this so I can practice with both relational data and React. I also would like to eventually be able to develop this with React Native.

#### Trello
https://trello.com/b/3OfrVIO6/project-3-slapsave

I had a difficult time zeroing in on what I wanted as my MVP, and I didn't use my Trello board as effectively as I did in Project 2. I ended up making Events my main CRUD resource.
